# Docker Compose Example

This project demonstrates how to use Docker Compose to run a multi-container application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Docker Compose file, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Run the Docker Compose command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

This will start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
